My name is Veronika Soukenková, and I am currently in my second year of studies at Charles University, Faculty of Humanities. I study history and philosophy, with anthropology as my specialization within the social sciences. As part of the Lumina project, I worked extensively with a database, focusing in particular on Registration Book A, where I created and refined annotations using the dedicated annotation interface. My academic interests center on modern history, with a strong emphasis on the period of the Second World War, which I find especially compelling from both historical and interpretative perspectives.
