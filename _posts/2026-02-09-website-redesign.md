We have redesigned the CHiP Lumina website to better reflect the current state and direction of the project.

The navigation has been simplified and reorganized. We removed pages that were no longer relevant and added new sections — **Objectives** and **Sources** — to provide a clearer overview of our research goals and the materials we work with. The **Updates** section will serve as a space for news and announcements going forward.

We hope the new structure makes it easier to follow the project and find the information you need.
