      <h2>Connected History Project</h2>
      <p>The Connected History Project (CHiP), undertaken by the <a href="http://www.mua.cas.cz/en">Masaryk Institute and Archives</a> of the Czech Academy of Science in Prague, is developing new methods for linking and analyzing heterogeneous archival sources using multimodal AI. Our case study focuses on prosecutions for violations of rationing and planned-economy regulations in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939–1945).</p>
      <p>We are digitising and connecting over 4,000 registry records, 250 detailed case files, and related legal documents — building an approach that can be applied to other archival collections beyond this initial material.</p>
